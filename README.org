yas - a sudo replacement

* What is this?
    yas, or 'yet another sudo', is a sudo replacement, written in rust and without really any configuration options or not needed features.
    It is intended for single user systems only, as it works out of the box, with no configuration needed, but you also can't restrict a user from running stuff as root.
    In case you really do have a user, that shouldn't be allowed to run stuff as root, this isn't for you.

* Installation
    You can get yas from a few package managers, such as the aur or cargo

    (this section is still todo, and the packages also don't exist yet .-.)

* Usage:
